    <h2>GitHub</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>What is Git?: Git is used to manage, create, edit, delete, and update open source code/projects.</li>
        <li>WHo started Git?: Linus Torvalds who is also the maker of the Linux operating system kernel. </li>
        <li>What is Hub?: Hub is a collection of devices connected to segments of a LAN or something similar.It holds 
            many ports and is a central place that unifies individuals/organizations.</li>
        <li>Describe Repository and its role: A Repository is a storage area or location where information and
            data can be stored, maintained and retrieved from. This may be accessed over a network.</li>
        <li>Your thoughts on GitHub: I find that this programming repository has the potential to be quite helpful for group
            assignment/projects. It reminds me a lot of Google docs. The information can be shared between many individuals and 
            each individual can view and edit the content. It will definitely be easier and more efficient than 
            having to send the code back and forth. It will take some getting used to but,
            I look forward to using and taking advantage of the many capabilities it has 
            to offer. </li>
